# CoIndex stance – non-truth index

Status: seed stance from CoIndex20251128 at 20251128T082030Z.

CoIndex is a **non-truth index**. It does not decide what is true; it maps where positions live.

## Core stance

- CoIndex maps:
  - sources (repos, paths, assets),
  - positions (docs, specs, manifestos, session notes),
  - lineages (which session or wave touched what, and when).
- CoIndex **does not** issue verdicts on factual truth, correctness or ethics.
  - Sessions that consume CoIndex remain responsible for their own judgement.
- CoIndex helpers should answer:
  - "Where should I look?"
  - "What is this asset for?"
  - "How does it relate to CoPlan IDs and CoBus events?"

## Helper expectations

- Each helper entry should:
  - point to a canonical asset, not a random copy,
  - include a short, honest summary,
  - carry provisional gib_terms and cluster tags to help CoEvo / CoIndex clustering,
  - reference any known CoPlan IDs (e.g. PRO-CoAgent, INI-CoIndex, etc.),
  - mention any CoBus events that are important for context.

## Future evolution

- Future sessions may:
  - refine the helper schema,
  - add machine-readable overlays (Gibber, JSON, etc.),
  - split this stance doc into human-facing and AI-facing layers.
- Any such changes should be logged in:
  - docs/helpers/CoIndex_SeedHelpers_*.md, and
  - CoSteward docs/intent/CoSessionRegistry_v1.md.
