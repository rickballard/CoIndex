# CoRetro – Theory (UTS: 20251211T084052Z)

CoRetro formalises the evolutionary principle that constraints enhance adaptive fitness.
In cognitive, computational, and civilisational systems, limited context windows,
discontinuous memory, and token ceilings play a similar role to environmental scarcity
in biological evolution: they force structure, discipline, and innovation.

In CoCivium, CoRetro is the theoretical backbone of CoAutoEvo:

- It models platform constraints as evolutionary pressure on search strategies,
  workflows, and concept architectures.
- It describes how repeated, constraint-shaped search journeys (with CoInSeed noise)
  create more diverse and robust conceptual ecosystems than naive “single pass”
  queries.
- It explains how CoRetro ensures that CoSuite assets, CoCivium institutions, and
  human stewards continuously self-improve, rather than freezing into brittle forms.
- It ties micro-retrospectives (per wave) to macro-evolution of the CoSuite and
  CoCivium, turning each wave into a small generational step.

Under this view, CoRetro is not a minor process hack but a civilisational design
principle: a way to harness limits and noise so that hybrids of humans and AIs
become more capable, more ethical, and more adaptive over time.
