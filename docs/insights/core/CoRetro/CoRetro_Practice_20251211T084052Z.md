# CoRetro – Practice (UTS: 20251211T084052Z)

This note captures how to *do* CoRetro inside CoCivium day to day.

## 1. End-of-wave micro-retro

At the end of each wave, record 3 quick bullets:

- What worked well this wave.
- What created friction or confusion.
- One micro-tweak to try next wave.

These can be carried in CoBus notices, session logs, or Sidekick/CoSteward notes.

## 2. Constraint-aware meta-search

When researching or evolving assets:

- Acknowledge constraints explicitly (token limits, time budget, missing tools).
- Split big questions into smaller passes; rotate perspectives each pass.
- Inject CoInSeed randomness (for example shuffled keywords, alternative framings,
  or, when available, external high-entropy sources).
- Deliberately include cross-domain sources (code, theory, governance, culture)
  rather than staying in one discipline.

## 3. Feed results back into CoSuite

On each CoRetro wave:

- Promote useful terms into GIBindex and CoGibber where appropriate.
- Attach Sidekick-style challenge/support notes to high-stakes theories
  (for example the Co-Theory of Civilization).
- Update insight pair folders (like this one) with new examples and counterexamples.
- Adjust CoAgent/CoArena prompts and rails so future waves benefit from what was learned.

## 4. Default stance

Any session that seeks to evolve:

- On-repo contents,
- Steward or citizen mental models,
- Or any CoCivium governance rails,

should treat CoRetro as its default search and reflection methodology, not an optional
extra. If in doubt: more, smaller CoRetros, feeding a few concrete tweaks forward.
