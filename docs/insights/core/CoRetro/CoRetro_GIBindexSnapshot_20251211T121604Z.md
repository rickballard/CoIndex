# GIBindex – Core CoTerms

This file is the starting point for CoSuite / CoCivium core CoTerms.
Each entry is append-only and time-stamped. Over time, additional
GIBindex facets (for example per-domain, per-repo, per-language)
can be split out.



### CoRetro (UTS: 20251211T091600Z)

- **Layer:** CoProcess / CoSearch / CoEvo  
- **Strata:** CoVibe, CoAutoEvo, CoMetaSearch, CoEvoPressure  
- **Status:** Core

**Short definition:**  
CoRetro is the dual-purpose micro-evolution engine of CoCivium:
1. A tiny end-of-wave retro pulse (process reflection plus next micro-tweak), and  
2. A recursive, constraint-aware, creativity-expanding search schema for generating deeper, more surprising, more diverse inferences, ideas, sources, and inspirations across constrained platforms.

**Long definition (summary):**  
CoRetro turns platform constraints (context limits, memory bounds, token ceilings, timeouts, missing tools, partial corpora) into evolutionary pressure. It uses multi-pass inquiry, randomized CoInSeed inspiration vectors (including, when available, cosmic-background / gravity-wave-derived randomness or other high-entropy sources), and broad cross-domain scanning (open-source code, academic prior art, governance models, biology, systems theory, mythic and cultural seeds) to escape local conceptual minima. Each wave ends with a micro-retro that feeds back into this meta-search, constantly refining processes, lexcom (via GIBindex), and CoAutoEvo rails.

**Key components:**  
- Micro-Retro: end-of-wave reflection and one concrete improvement for the next wave.  
- Constraint-Aware Search: treats limits as creative pressure.  
- CoInSeed Randomization: injects noise/inspiration to avoid ruts and eigenvector collapse.  
- Cosmic-Sampling (when possible): uses high-entropy external sources as “mutation” seed.  
- Multi-Pass Inquiry: recursive re-searching with rotated perspectives.  
- External Repo Scans: scans OSS and other assets for borrowable/forkable patterns.  
- Lexcom Update Hook: feeds learnings back into GIBindex and CoTerms.  
- CoAutoEvo Integration: continuously refines CoSuite assets, user minds, and governance rails.
