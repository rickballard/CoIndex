### CoRetro (UTS: 20251211T121609Z)

- **Layer:** CoProcess / CoSearch / CoEvo
- **Strata:** CoVibe, CoAutoEvo, CoMetaSearch, CoEvoPressure
- **Status:** Core

**Short definition:**
CoRetro is the dual-purpose micro-evolution engine of CoCivium:
1. A tiny end-of-wave retro pulse (reflection plus one concrete micro-tweak), and
2. A recursive, constraint-aware, creativity-expanding search schema for generating deeper, more surprising, more diverse inferences, ideas, sources, and inspirations across constrained platforms.

**Long definition (summary):**
CoRetro turns platform constraints (context limits, memory bounds, token ceilings, timeouts, missing tools, partial corpora) into evolutionary pressure. It uses multi-pass inquiry, randomized CoInSeed inspiration vectors (including, when available, high-entropy external sources), and broad cross-domain scanning to escape local conceptual minima. Each wave ends with a micro-retro that feeds back into this meta-search, refining processes, lexcom, and CoAutoEvo rails.

**Key components:**
- Micro-Retro: end-of-wave reflection plus one improvement for the next wave.
- Constraint-Aware Search.
- CoInSeed Randomization.
- Multi-Pass Inquiry.
- External Repo Scans.
- Lexcom Update Hook.
- CoAutoEvo Integration.
