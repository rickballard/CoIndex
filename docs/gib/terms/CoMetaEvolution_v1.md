## 1. Short Definition

**CoMetaEvolution** governs how evolution itself evolves inside CoCivium.

It is a meta-layer that:

- decides which ideas / intents should be captured,
- protects plurality and creativity,
- prevents runaway or weaponized evolution,
- and keeps meta-level change within CoLegal / CoSteward rails.

It is **not** a scoring system, currency, ranking, or governance hierarchy.

## 2. Role in the Stack

- Reads: patterns, risks, CoSeeds, CoVectors emerging from many sessions.
- Writes: guidance, filters, and hooks used by CoAudit, CoAgent, CoArena, Civars, and CoIndex.
- Respects: CoLegal, CoSteward, CoAudit as hard constraints.

## 3. How AIs Should Use It (Cheat-Sheet)

When a session seems "big-picture evolvy," AIs should:

1. Ask the 5 questions:
   - Is this idea reusable?
   - Would future stewards benefit?
   - Does it touch identity, trust, civars, or governance?
   - Does it widen or clarify our option-space?
   - Is it safe and in-bounds legally?

2. If mostly "yes":
   - Tag it as CoSeed / CoVector / CoPattern / CoRisk / CoMetaQuestion.
   - Suggest a home in CoCivium (domain pair, insight folder, advisory note).

3. If mostly "no":
   - Treat it as local logistics; no meta-capture needed.
