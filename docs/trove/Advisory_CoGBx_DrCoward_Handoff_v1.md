# Advisory: CoGBx → DrCoward session handoff v1

Generated: 20251202T164840Z

This note records the handoff from the CoGBx session to a future session labelled "DrCoward", which will focus on packaging CoGBx for Dr. Alexander Coward.

## Pointers

- Alex-facing note (primary link)
  - docs/CoGBx/CoGBx_Welcome_AlexCoward_v1.md

- CoGBx Charter v0
  - docs/CoGBx/CoGBx_Charter_v0.md

- GB20251202 Lexicon v0
  - docs/CoGBx/CoGBx_Lexicon_GB20251202_v0.md

- Edge Contributor Console – CoGBx Intent Card v0
  - docs/CoGBx/examples/CoGBx_Intent_EdgeContributorConsole_v0.yaml

- CoGBx Portal manifest
  - docs/CoPortals/CoGBxPortal_CoIndex_manifest_v0.json

## Intent

- Preserve CoGBx as a top-layer, metaphor-based language for edge contributors (City / Studio / Garden).
- Invite Alex’s expertise on:
  - making this language usable and motivating for non-technical people,
  - shaping Steward Console UI patterns,
  - and exploring viable business and research directions.

Future sessions can treat this advisory as the anchor for any DrCoward-facing work.
