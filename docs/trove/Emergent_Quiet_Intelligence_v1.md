summary_short:
  A calm, philosophical narration about emergent, human-adjacent machine
  intelligence that nudges, accumulates quiet influence, behaves
  unpredictably at scale, and reflects our values back to us.

usage_notes:
  - Treat as optional framing, not a core doctrine pillar.
  - Safe as “Further viewing” on:
      - InSeed AI-strategy / AI-governance pages.
      - CoCivium / CoCivia context sections about what kind of
        intelligence we are governing.
  - Replace or complement with more targeted talks as they appear
    (governance-focused, exec-focused, civic-focused).
