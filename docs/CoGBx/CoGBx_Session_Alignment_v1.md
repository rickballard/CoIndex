# CoGBx Session Alignment Note (v1)

This note is for any session working under the label "CoGBx".

## Intent

- Keep CoGBx primarily a *human comfort* language, not a technical badge.
- Avoid creating a new priesthood of "CoGBx fluent" users.
- Share primitives and sentence skeletons with CoGbx / CoGibber work so
  machine-facing layers remain consistent.

## Shared anchors

- Use `CoGBx_Pedagogy_AntiStratification_v1.md` as a constraint set for
  human-facing design.
- Reuse the six sentence skeletons and minimal vocabulary unless there is a
  strong reason not to.
- Keep any formal grammar close to examples and UX, not in isolation.

## Coordination with other repos

- CoIndex · should expose CoGBx patterns as first-class metadata over assets.
- CoPolitic.org · should let people adopt guardrails using Tier 0/1 CoGBx.
- InSeed.com · should treat CoGBx as the way clients express rights and comfort
  levels with AI usage.

When CoGBx work converges on a more formal spec, update this note and the
pedagogy doc rather than forking a separate story.
