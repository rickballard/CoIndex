# CoGBx: Edge-First Language – Quick Tour

Generated: 20251202T160824Z  

Hi Alex,

This is a tiny tour of **CoGBx**, the language we are designing so that non-technical edge contributors can steer complex systems without touching code.

CoGBx sits above the implementation and gives people a way to talk about:

- **Cities, buildings, and rooms** – how the system is laid out  
- **Shows and scenes** – how people move through it  
- **Gardens and seeds** – how new ideas are planted and tested  

AIs then translate that CoGBx intent into the lower-level specs and code.

---

## 1. Start here – what CoGBx is

**CoGBx Charter v0**  
A short definition of CoGBx as our “most abstract” language for hybrid society, plus the three metaphor families (City, Studio, Garden) and the No-One-Left-Behind principle.

- [Open the Charter](CoGBx_Charter_v0.md)

## 2. Field sample – real “Co*” words in the wild

**GB20251202 Lexicon v0**  
A de-duplicated list of Co-prefixed terms that have already emerged in GroupBuild and CoIndex onramps work, with a checklist for deciding:

- which ones are friendly enough for non-technical contributors,  
- which belong behind the scenes in the lower CoGibber layer,  
- which should be renamed or retired.

- [Open the Lexicon](CoGBx_Lexicon_GB20251202_v0.md)

## 3. One example – what CoGBx feels like in use

**Edge Contributor Console – CoGBx Intent Card v0**  
A single YAML example that describes a simple “Home” console for contributors in CoGBx terms:

- where in the “city” it lives,  
- what the “show” and “scenes” are,  
- what the emotional and practical promise is,  
- and what guardrails must always hold.

## 4. How you could help (if you ever feel like it)

If you scan only these three files and ignore everything else, you will still see enough to:

- Judge whether the City / Studio / Garden metaphors are workable for non-technical users  
- Spot Co* terms in the lexicon that feel confusing, heavy, or need gentler alternatives  
- Suggest better question flows or UI patterns that let scared newcomers still tell the system what kind of world they want

Everything else (CoGibber, portals, code) lives underneath this layer.  
CoGBx is the part we hope can be safe, humane, and teachable.

Thanks for even glancing at this.
