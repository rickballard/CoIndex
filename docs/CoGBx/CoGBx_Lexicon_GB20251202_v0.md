## Sanity-check checklist (per term)

For each term above, review and annotate:

- **Role in CoGBx stack**  
  - City word / Studio word / Garden word / Other?  
  - Is this a *metaphor* (e.g., CoBeacon) or a *module name* (e.g., CoIndex)?

- **Clarity for non-technical contributors**  
  - Would a first-time edge contributor roughly guess what this means?  
  - If not, can we rename or pair it with a friendlier explanation?

- **Overlap and redundancy**  
  - Does this duplicate an existing concept under a different name?  
  - Should it be merged, demoted to an alias, or kept distinct?

- **Emotional and civic tone**  
  - Does the term feel inclusive, calm, and stewardship-aligned?  
  - Avoid metaphors that imply war, punishment, or exclusion unless that is intentionally constrained.

- **Fitness for CoGBx**  
  - Is this something we want in the *top-layer language* (CoGBx) or is it better hidden in CoGibber / internal code?

Write short notes next to each term, for example:

- CoBeacon – Garden/City metaphor: signals and focal points. Good CoGBx word.  
- CoOnrampX – Onboarding pattern; maybe unify naming across repos.  

This lexicon is the review surface before we show the next language wave to external collaborators (e.g., Dr Coward).
