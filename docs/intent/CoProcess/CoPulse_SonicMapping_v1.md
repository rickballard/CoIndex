# CoPulse Sonic Mapping (v1)

Seeded: 20251206T192038Z

CoPulse is the audible (and visual) expression of CoHeart's signals.

It turns structured events about CoCivium's health into sound patterns that
CoCivites and CoStewards can listen to, like a heartbeat or whalesong of the system.

## 1. Event Inputs

Examples of events:
- New CoMetaTrain-aligned meta fields landed.
- CoAntiReinvention protocol used to resolve a collision.
- New CoSteward FitLedger entries written.
- New CoScendence insights or rubrics added.
- CoBPOE/Core updates merged.
- CoCacheGlobal sync pulses.

Each event has:
- Type (merge, new asset, deprecation, refactor, warning, etc.).
- Magnitude (small tweak vs large conceptual change).
- Health data (OK / SOFT / HARD / FATAL style).

## 2. Sonic Mapping (initial ideas)

- Tempo:
  - Overall event rate.
  - More activity = slightly faster pulse, but with humane upper bounds.

- Pitch range:
  - Health indicator:
    - Lower tones when CoBloat or CoHealth warnings appear.
    - Higher, more melodic tones when CoScendence-aligned work lands.

- Harmony:
  - Cross-repo alignment:
    - Consonant chords when CoMetaTrain, BPOE, GIBindex and CoRef show healthy convergence.
    - Mild dissonance when lineage collisions or reinvention patterns appear.

- Motifs (short patterns):
  - Chimes for new stewardship/CoScendence lineage entries.
  - Deep gongs for constitutional changes (e.g. Cognocarta Consenti updates).
  - Rising arpeggios for major CoScendence milestones.

## 3. Human Comfort

To keep this beautiful for most humans:
- Favor consonant intervals and gentle detuning.
- Use envelopes and timbres similar to:
  - strings, choirs, bells, oceanic ambience.
- Avoid harsh, sudden spikes unless signaling severe issues (HARD/FATAL).

## 4. Integration with Sites and CoScendence

- CoPulse streams should be consumable via CoGbx so that:
  - Sites repo (incl. CoScendence.org/.com) can expose:
    - live "heartbeat" streams,
    - recorded "CoPulse" archives.

- CoScendence-focused sites may:
  - give listeners a sense of how the CoSuite is evolving,
  - show visualizations synchronized with the audio whalesong.
