# CoAura Spec v1

> CoAura is the name for the AI facing "presence layer" of a site or product in
> the CoSuite. It replaces the older "portal" language. Humans see sites and
> apps. AIs see CoAura and CoGbx.

CoAura is the declared aura of a product or site as seen by AIs:

- what the site is for
- who it serves
- what business model it runs under
- what identity and safety stance it takes
- how AIs are expected to interact with it

CoAura works together with:

- SiteWave (human facing)
- CoGbx (structured, AI facing)

The rest of the spec lives here and will be evolved in future waves.
