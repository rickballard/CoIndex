# CoIndex – Standards Integration Roadmap v1
Mission Id   : CoIndex_BackboneDesign2025_Mission
Session label: MurphyPlus_CoIndex20251123
Stamp        : 20251125T215502Z

## Phase 0 – Schema and notes (this session)

- Add StandardsTag spec into CoIndex (this file set).
- Record CoSync note for Standards and CoIndex.
- Confirm that standards are treated as first-class CoIndex nodes (std: ids).

## Phase 1 – Pilot standards alignment

- Choose 1–2 TOON-style profiles (or similar).
- Model them as std: CoPointees in CoIndex.
- Attach StandardsTag instances to:
  - one CoPortal
  - a small set of repos (e.g. CoCivium, CoCache, CoCore).
- Expose a simple "standards" section in a CoPortal overlay.

## Phase 2 – External visibility

- Add machine-readable views so standards bodies can:
  - read standards alignment overlays
  - see CoPortals and GitHub communities as live evidence.
- Integrate with ScriptTag / PTAG / RepTag and MeritRank
  so "standards contribution" becomes a visible dimension of reputation.

## Phase 3 – Co1 and Standards session stewardship

- Hand long-term semantics and governance of StandardsTag and std: nodes
  to Co1 and the Standards-focused sessions.
- Keep CoIndex as the semantic backbone, not as a parallel standards body.
