## 1. Indexing view

From the CoIndex perspective, CoMetaEvolution is:

- a source of decisions about which concepts become canonical terms  
- a set of rails for when and how to register new GIBindex entries  
- a protection against over-indexing noise

When a term proposal looks “meta-evolutionary” in nature, CoIndex should:

- cross-check with CoMetaEvolution practice,  
- ensure we are not hard-coding one ideology or one narrow view,  
- prefer definitions that keep future options open.
