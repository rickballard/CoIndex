# CoHeart Weekly Ritual Stub (v1)
Seeded: 20251208T010928Z
Session: CoEvoEmergents

This is *not* automation.  
It is a human-readable, low-risk weekly ritual outline for CoIndex and CoSteward maintainers.

## Purpose
- Ensure key lineage, footer hygiene, and CoCTA pilot areas stay alive and visible.
- Reinforce coherence across repos without generating prompts or nags.

## Weekly Checklist
1. Run: tools/CoMetaTrain_Lineage_Scan_Stub.ps1  
2. Check for missing/old CoLife / CoPotential footers on lighthouse assets.  
3. Review GIBindex for CoTerm updates relevant to CoIndex.  
4. Log optional notes in CoHeart/CoPulse folders if desired (no enforcement).  

This ritual may evolve in future waves; this is the seed.
