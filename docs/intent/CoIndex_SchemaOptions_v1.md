## Schema Family A — Pure Concept–Intent
- Pros: simple, clean, fast.
- Cons: insufficient for safe evolution; missing X,S,K vectors.

## Schema Family B — C–I–X Model
Adds context (domain, conditions).
- Pros: flexible, interpretable.
- Cons: no state tracking; no constraints.

## Schema Family C — C–I–X–S Model
Adds state (real-world readings).
- Pros: captures dynamic meaning.
- Cons: still unsafe without ethical constraints.

## Schema Family D — Full C–I–X–S–K
Adds constraints (ethics, civic rules, guardrails).
- Pros: safest, evolution-ready, audit-friendly.
- Cons: more complex; requires good governance layers.

## Recommendation
Schema Family **D (C–I–X–S–K)** is required for CoIndex given:
- evolution pressures,
- civic guardrails,
- edge governance,
- reputation systems,
- integration with CoSteward, CoPortal, GIBindex, and CoNuggets.
