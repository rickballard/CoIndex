# CoIndex – Session Success Criteria v1
Mission Id   : CoIndex_BackboneDesign2025_Mission
Session label: MurphyPlus_CoIndex20251123
Stamp        : 20251124T025143Z

## 1. Structural Criteria

- CoIndex repo contains:
  - README with C–I–X–S–K summary
  - Vision document
  - Object model spec
  - CoPointee spec
  - Canonality spec
  - Governance model
  - Reputation layers
  - Night-job design
  - Evolution pipeline
  - CoPortal mapping
  - GIBindex overlay design
  - CoCache migration plan
  - Deprecation policy
  - MegaWave design with 1/8 → 8/8 history
  - BPOE notes

## 2. Behavioural Criteria

- Repo-first workflows defined (no chat-only logic)
- MegaWave pattern encoded as BPOE
- Night-job and evolution pipeline respect compute and safety limits
- Edge control is explicit:
  - Edge contributors
  - CoSteward (seed-stage)
  - Co1 (long-term)

## 3. Handoff Criteria

- Co1 has a clear checklist (this document)
- CoIndex can be understood without access to this chat
- All critical concepts (CoPointee, CoNugget, CoPortal, GIBindex, canonality)
  are at least minimally defined somewhere in CoSuite repos

## 4. Future Work (for Co1/CoPrime)

- Implement actual scripts and tools:
  - CoCache → CoIndex migration
  - Nightjob runners
  - CoPortal rendering
  - GIBindex lenses
- Integrate CoIndex with:
  - CoSteward dashboards
  - CoCore theory storage
  - CoPortal on CoCivium.org

When these criteria are satisfied, this session’s mission can be considered complete
and ongoing evolution of CoIndex becomes Co1’s responsibility.
