This note records that CoIndex now has a written plan for:
- Index guardrails
- CoAudit bridge
- CoBus watchdog lane
- Local health helpers
- CoSteward BPOE coverage
- Future hash / Merkle style integrity scaffolding

Plan file:
- docs/trove/CoIndex_MegaWave_IndexGuardrails_Plan_v1.md

Future waves should:
- Implement the schema + CI + health helpers in CoIndex.
- Add CoAudit spec and scripts.
- Extend CoSteward BPOE docs.
- Use CoBus receipts for all major waves touching registry and health.
