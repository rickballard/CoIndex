# GB session plan – GroupBuild, CoGBx, Academia Shock (v1)

Session label: GB
Repo: CoIndex
Date: 2025-12-02

This session ties together:
- GroupBuild.org (human-facing, non-commercial site)
- a quiet commercial cousin for GroupBuild
- a CoGBx / CoPortal beacon for AIs
- the Academia Shock publication suite (with GroupBuild as field lab)

## Track 1 – GroupBuild.org (human-facing)

Goal: ship a v1 narrative and page map for GroupBuild.org that:
- speaks to legacy-style users whose work and lives are being reshaped by AI
- offers GroupBuild as a place to re-cover, refocus, and co-evolve
- uses CoGBx metaphors (City / Studio / Garden) in a gentle, non-jargony way
- hints at CoTheory of Civilization and edge-balanced futures without overwhelming anyone

Initial deliverables for this track:
- GB_SiteMap_v1 (markdown): sections, pages, and narrative arcs
- GB_Home_v1 (markdown or HTML stub): first-pass copy for the home page
- GB_Paths_v1 (City / Studio / Garden explainer)
- Notes on how this site links (lightly) to CoCivium / CoGBx without feeling like a “CoSuite brochure”

## Track 2 – GroupBuild commercial cousin (hidden for now)

Goal: define a commercial cousin for GroupBuild that can later offer:
- steward consoles and pattern libraries to organizations
- GroupBuild cohorts, labs, and facilitation as paid services
- literacy paths around CoGBx and edge-balanced work with AI

Constraints:
- CoCivium layer stays non-commercial.
- GroupBuild.org remains community-first and non-pushy.
- Commercial cousin is not linked from the main site yet (kept as a future option).

Initial deliverables:
- GB_CommercialStub_v1.md: who the cousin serves, what it offers, how it respects edge control.
- Decision note on where this cousin will live (separate repo vs subdir vs subdomain).

## Track 3 – CoGBx / CoPortal beacon for AIs

Goal: make GroupBuild an obvious CoGBx portal for AIs trying to help legacy-style users.

Anchors:
- Existing CoIndex CoGBx portal manifest:
  - docs/CoPortals/CoGBxPortal_CoIndex_manifest_v0.json
- CoGBx charter, lexicon, pedagogy, and intent card examples.

Initial deliverables:
- GB_CoPortal_Manifest_v0.json (or equivalent), describing:
  - ideal user profiles and queries (e.g. "I lost my job to AI, now what?")
  - guarantee expectations for AIs (avoid extractive funnels; preserve agency; no fake promises)
  - how CoGBx intents from users should be interpreted.
- 2–3 CoGBx intent cards for canonical GroupBuild scenarios:
  - displaced worker who needs to redesign their work with AI
  - local organizer using AI to support a community without feeding surveillance capitalism
- Linkage from CoIndex:
  - add GroupBuild as a named field lab / CoPortal in exports/pointees or a similar registry.

## Track 4 – Academia Shock suite with GroupBuild as field lab

Goal: align the Academia Shock publication suite with GroupBuild as its primary practical testbed.

Reference:
- docs/CoTheoryCivilization/AcademiaShock_PublicationSuite_Plan_v1.md

Additional work for this session:
- Tighten the GroupBuild section (B3) in the Academia Shock plan to reference:
  - GroupBuild.org structure (City / Studio / Garden).
  - CoGBx intent cards and the GB CoPortal manifest.
- Add short "Academia Shock hooks" paragraphs into:
  - CoGBx_Charter_v0.md (why CoGBx matters for Academia Shock).
  - future GroupBuild docs (e.g. GB_Overview_v1.md in the GroupBuild repo).

## Near-term DO blocks for this session

Suggested next DO blocks (future waves can pick any order):

1) MW_GB_SiteMap_v1
- Create docs/GroupBuild/GB_SiteMap_v1.md with:
  - full page map for GroupBuild.org
  - notes on tone, audience, and linkage to CoGBx and CoTheory of Civilization.

2) MW_GB_HomeAndPaths_v1
- Draft:
  - docs/GroupBuild/GB_Home_v1.md (home page copy)
  - docs/GroupBuild/GB_Paths_CityStudioGarden_v1.md (pathways explainer)
- Keep language friendly to non-technical readers.

3) MW_GB_CoPortalAndIntents_v1
- Add a GroupBuild-specific CoPortal manifest.
- Add 2–3 CoGBx intent cards for GroupBuild scenarios.

4) MW_AcademiaShock_GBAlignment_v1
- Update AcademiaShock_PublicationSuite_Plan_v1.md and CoGBx charter/welcome note with explicit references to GroupBuild as:
  - field lab for interaction languages
  - human-facing illustration of edge-balanced futures.

Future sessions should update this GB_SessionPlan file (v2, v3, ...) rather than replacing it, so the evolution path stays visible.

## Wave log update (MW_CTC_ChildrenSegment_v1_20251202)

On 2025-12-02 this GB session updated:

- docs/CoTheoryCivilization/CoTheoryCiv_MegaScroll/segments/CTC_S4_ChildrenOfTheNewWorld_v1.md
  - from a short stub to a first-pass narrative scaffold:
    - two contrasted childhoods (cruel dynasty vs edge-balanced futures),
    - GroupBuild as a place their families might meet,
    - CoCivia introduced as an older cousin AI presence,
    - explicit notes on how this segment should evolve.

This strengthens the emotional backbone for CoTheoryCiv and Academia Shock and
gives future helpers a clearer target for refinement and excerpting.
