# CoBus Notice – CoVibe Protocol (v1)

Status: CoStaged_v1
LastUpdatedUTS: SESSION_UTS_PLACEHOLDER

---

## 1. What changed

This notice tells CoBus and Co1 that a **CoVibe Protocol** has been defined and staged as:

- a core protocol doc, and
- a GIBindex term.

The protocol gives sessions and repos a common way to declare:

- the tone they are aiming for,
- the intensity of that tone,
- the "voice" and style being used,
- the brand and term set in play.

---

## 2. Why it matters

CoVibe helps:

- humans understand what kind of "room" they have walked into,
- AIs align their language with the declared tone,
- CoMetaEvolution and CoContrast reason about safety and perspective.

It is especially useful when:

- multiple AIs are involved in the same session,
- assets are shared across contexts (ops, public, academic),
- we need to keep tone civic-first and non-manipulative.

---

## 3. Where to wire it

Suggested first integration points:

- CoSteward handoff notes to Co1 and other sessions,
- CoCivium domain and insights docs that deal with evolution and safety,
- CoIndex GIBindex entries for terms that strongly depend on tone,
- CoAgent and CoArena panels where humans see summaries.

---

## 4. Safety note

CoVibe is descriptive, not coercive.

It must never be used to:

- hide risk,
- oversell certainty,
- or push people toward any belief system.

For sensitive topics and for users with fragile contexts, CoVibe should lean toward:

- calm,
- honest,
- civic-first framing.
