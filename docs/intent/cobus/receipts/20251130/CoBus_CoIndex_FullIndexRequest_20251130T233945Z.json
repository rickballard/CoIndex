  "notes": "Request from CoIndex: please schedule a long-running, idempotent CoIndex backfill over active CoSuite repos (CoSteward, CoCivium, CoAgent, CoArena, InSeed, etc.) to populate cogibber.registry views and CoGbx pointees. Safe to run as background/overnight waves; goal is to make CoIndex the canonical, searchable registry of repo assets so future sessions and AIs can always discover, audit, and orchestrate work via CoGibber/CoGbx instead of transient memory."
