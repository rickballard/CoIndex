# CoBus Notice – CoVibe + Session Health Rails (v1)

Status: CoStaged_v1
UTS: 20251208T145951Z

---

## 1. CoVibe recap

Rails added:

- CoCivium:
  - docs/intent/CoVibe/CoVibe_Protocol_v1.md
- CoIndex:
  - docs/gib/terms/CoVibe_v1.md
  - docs/intent/cobus/CoBus_CoVibe_Notice_v1.md

CoVibe describes:

- CoVoice (tone and sound of replies),
- CoStyle (format, pacing, density),
- CoBrand (how CoCivium feels),
- CoTerms (preferred vocabulary).

---

## 2. Session health and tab reset rail

New BPOE note:

- CoSteward:
  - docs/intent/CoBPOE/CoBPOE_SessionHealth_v1.md

Key message:

- Closing a sluggish tab and reopening the same session is:
  - a first-class hygiene tool,
  - a way to reset browser bloat,
  - not a failure or “loss” of the session.

Co1 and future orchestration should treat this as normal and encouraged.

---

## 3. CoEvoPacing insights pair

New insights:

- CoCivium:
  - docs/insights/CoEvoPacing/theory_v1.md
  - docs/insights/CoEvoPacing/practice_v1.md

Purpose:

- Give sessions and stewards language to talk about:
  - how **fast** we evolve,
  - when to slow down,
  - when to run experimental branches instead of mainline changes.

---

## 4. Suggestions for Co1 and orchestration

- When CoBloat or CoHealth tools detect HU / WT levels:
  - recommend tab resets and session rotation explicitly.
- When many P3/P4 CoEvoPacing changes accumulate:
  - encourage stabilisation waves and CoSync notes.
- Let CoAgent / CoArena surfaces:
  - a simple CoVibeLevel selector,
  - a CoHealth indicator,
  - and hints when a tab/session reset is timely.
