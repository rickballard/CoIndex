# CoTheory of Civilization (CoTheoryCiv) schema and naming v1

Session label: GB
Repo: CoIndex (docs/CoTheoryCivilization)
Date: 2025-12-02

This document declares CoTheory of Civilization (CoTheoryCiv) as the umbrella
theory for how human plus AI civilizations drift toward a small set of
attractors, and how we might re-shape those attractors toward edge-balanced
futures.

It also places Academia Shock and GroupBuild under that umbrella, and sketches
how future helpers and tools (including megascrollers) will assemble public
scrolls from modular segments.

## Naming stack

- CoTheory of Civilization (CoTheoryCiv)
  - The umbrella theory.
  - Focus: attractors for hybrid civilizations, guarantees and layers, and
    edge-balanced futures vs cruel dynasties.
  - Lives primarily in this repo under docs/CoTheoryCivilization and in
    connected best-practice fragments in CoCore.

- Academia Shock
  - A named publication series and campaign under CoTheoryCiv.
  - Focus: shaking awake academics, funders, strategy circles, and civic
    stewards to the concrete risks and opportunities of AI-shaped attractors.
  - Flagship pieces (from AcademiaShock_PublicationSuite_Plan_v1.md):
    - A1: CoTheory of Civilization: core-controlled vs edge-balanced futures.
    - A2: ENSO-layered guarantees and "what you may safely assume".
    - A3: Interaction languages for non-technical stewards (CoGBx).

- GroupBuild
  - The primary field lab (for now) where CoTheoryCiv and Academia Shock are
    made tangible for people whose work is being reshaped by AI.
  - Assets:
    - docs/GroupBuild/GB_SiteMap_v1.md
    - docs/GroupBuild/GB_Home_v1.md
    - docs/GroupBuild/GB_Paths_CityStudioGarden_v1.md

## Roles and audiences

CoTheoryCiv serves multiple overlapping audiences:

- Theory and systems people
  - Complexity, governance, AI risk, political economy, and strategy circles.
  - Care about attractors, guarantees, and institutional designs.

- Field-lab stewards
  - People running places like GroupBuild who need:
    - simple metaphors for non-technical participants;
    - strong guarantees and guardrails behind the scenes.

- Story carriers
  - People who will write, speak, or teach about:
    - core-controlled vs edge-balanced futures;
    - children growing up in AI-shaped civilizations;
    - what it means to be a good ancestor in a hybrid world.

CoTheoryCiv is not a traditional academic theory that lives only in papers.
It is intended to be:

- modular (segments and manifests rather than one monolith),
- multi-voiced (open to co-authors and field labs),
- and renderable in many forms (megascrolls, briefs, stories, talks).

## Relationship to Academia Shock

Academia Shock is the first named publication suite under CoTheoryCiv.

- A1, A2, and A3 are "flagship" pieces that carry the heavier theory and
  method load.
- Additional Tier B and Tier C pieces translate these ideas into:
  - technical notes (CoGibber, CoPortals, GIBindex),
  - bridge pieces (manifestos, executive briefs, teaching aids).

GroupBuild provides:

- lived examples of displaced workers and local organizers,
- CoGBx patterns that show how non-technical people talk about their reality,
- and data to test whether interaction languages and guarantees work in
  practice.

In this sense:

- CoTheoryCiv explains why these futures matter.
- Academia Shock explains what needs to be said and shown to wake people up.
- GroupBuild shows how it feels in everyday life.

## Relationship to CoCore and best-practice fragments

CoCore is the global best-practice database where:

- specific practices, checklists, and rubrics are stored,
- each fragment can point back to:
  - CoTheoryCiv segments (for justification),
  - field-lab results (for evidence).

Over time:

- CoTheoryCiv will reference CoCore entries as examples of "good practice",
- CoCore will reference CoTheoryCiv segments as "why this matters" context.

This document does not define that interface in detail; it simply records the
intent that CoTheoryCiv and CoCore remain tightly linked but modular.

## Megascrolls and segments

Many CoCivium-facing publications will need to be:

- long, continuous scrolls for human readers,
- constructed from smaller segments for AI helpers and editors.

To support this, CoTheoryCiv content is being organized as:

- individual segments under:
  - docs/CoTheoryCivilization/CoTheoryCiv_MegaScroll/segments
- a manifest file that:
  - lists segments,
  - tags them by role and emotional job,
  - defines different "views" (full megascroll, academic excerpt, media
    excerpt, children-of-the-new-world excerpt, etc).

Helpers like Co1 and any future megascroller helper can then assemble:

- one scroll for CoCivium.org,
- one scroll for preprint servers,
- shorter versions for talks, decks, and explainers,

all from the same underlying segments.

## Current status (v1)

At this point:

- CoTheoryCiv is formally declared as the umbrella.
- Academia Shock is recorded as a named series under CoTheoryCiv.
- GroupBuild is recorded as the primary field lab for this phase.
- A basic CoTheoryCiv megascroll basket and manifest stub exist.

Future versions of this schema file should record changes in:

- the set of segments,
- the status of flagship pieces,
- new field labs or companion sites added under the same umbrella.
