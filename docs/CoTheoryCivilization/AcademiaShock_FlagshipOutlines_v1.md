## A1 – CoTheory of Civilization: core-controlled vs edge-balanced futures (outline v1)

**Working title**

> CoTheory of Civilization: Attractors for Human + AI Societies and the Cost of Ignoring the Edge

**Goal**

- Explain the idea of attractors for hybrid civilizations.
- Contrast **core-controlled** vs **edge-balanced** futures.
- Make the “cruel dynasty” attractor emotionally and intellectually legible.
- Show that edge-balanced futures are fragile but still reachable if we act early.

**Primary readers**

- Academics in governance, AI risk, complexity, and political economy.
- Strategists in institutions that quietly shape futures (funders, think tanks, central technologists).
- Stewards who need language to talk to their boards and peers.

**Core sections (sketch)**

1. **The attractor landscape for hybrid civilizations**
   - What we mean by attractors in this context.
   - How AI and automation change the “cost” of:
     - surveillance,
     - steering,
     - punishment,
     - narrative control.
   - Pointers to CTC_S1_Attractors_v1.md.

2. **Core-controlled futures**
   - Patterns where a small number of institutional or platform cores:
     - set the rules,
     - own the sensing infrastructure,
     - and can cheaply enforce compliance.
   - Examples:
     - platformized economies,
     - tightly integrated surveillance states,
     - vertically integrated AI stacks.
   - “Cruel dynasty” as the least desired attractor:
     - not necessarily cartoon evil,
     - but structurally indifferent or hostile to most humans.

3. **Edge-balanced futures**
   - Futures where:
     - everyday people retain meaningful veto and steering power,
     - small groups can still invent and resist,
     - institutional designs slow down unilateral moves by cores.
   - Role of:
     - guarantees,
     - transparent protocols,
     - edge-owned guardrails.

4. **Why AI shifts the odds**
   - How AI tools:
     - make it easier to move toward core-controlled attractors by default,
     - can also be used to protect edges when designed deliberately.
   - Early examples from GroupBuild and similar field labs:
     - people using AI to understand and reframe their situation,
     - not just to comply with core demands.

5. **Implications for institutions**
   - Questions boards, funders, and stewards should be asking.
   - Bridges to A2 (ensured layers) and A3 (interaction languages).

**Connections**

- Builds primarily on:
  - CTC_S1_Attractors_v1.md,
  - with emotional reinforcement from CTC_S4_ChildrenOfTheNewWorld_v1.md.
- Uses GroupBuild as:
  - a contrasting patch of edge-balanced practice,
  - evidence that different attractors can be pursued intentionally.

## A2 – ENSO-layered guarantees and “what you may safely assume” (outline v1)

**Working title**

> What You May Safely Assume: Ensured Layers for Hybrid Civilizations

**Goal**

- Translate ENSO-like guarantee work and related efforts into CoTheoryCiv terms.
- Show why “layers of guarantees” are the spine between:
  - high-level theory (A1),
  - field-lab practice (GroupBuild),
  - and day-to-day engineering/operations decisions.

**Primary readers**

- Protocol designers and infrastructure architects.
- Policy, legal, and governance researchers.
- People building or regulating AI platforms and portals.

**Core sections (sketch)**

1. **From slogans to layers**
   - Why “trust the system” is not enough.
   - “What you may safely assume” as a civilizational design question.
   - Connect to CTC_S2_EnsuredLayers_v1.md.

2. **Ensured layers in a hybrid stack**
   - Model: layers from human intent down to machine execution and back.
   - Examples of layers:
     - legible rights / expectations for users and stewards,
     - auditability and contestability mechanisms,
     - technical guardrails in CoPortals and platforms.

3. **Weak guarantees and cruel dynasties**
   - How fuzziness and loopholes in guarantees:
     - favour cores with legal, technical, or economic power,
     - make it easy to drift toward oppressive attractors.

4. **Strong edge-respecting guarantees**
   - Properties of guarantees that keep power near the edge:
     - simple to understand,
     - hard to quietly bypass,
     - enforceable by or with help of the edge.
   - How these appear in:
     - CoPortals (e.g. GroupBuild_CoPortal_manifest_v0.json),
     - interaction languages (CoGBx charter).

5. **Research and design agenda**
   - Questions and experiments for:
     - ENSO-like work,
     - standards bodies,
     - civic and regulatory frameworks.
   - Connect to:
     - A1 for why it matters,
     - A3 for how people actually meet these guarantees in interfaces.

**Connections**

- Builds primarily on:
  - CTC_S2_EnsuredLayers_v1.md,
  - GroupBuild CoPortal and CoGBx charter.
- Should eventually link to:
  - specific CoCore best-practice fragments.

## A3 – Interaction languages for non-technical stewards (CoGBx) (outline v1)

**Working title**

> Talking to Civilization: Interaction Languages for Non-Technical Stewards

**Goal**

- Show why non-technical stewards need interaction languages that:
  - respect their time, attention, and dignity,
  - map to real guarantees and levers,
  - work across many tools and portals.
- Present CoGBx as one concrete attempt, grounded in GroupBuild.

**Primary readers**

- Designers and product people building interfaces to complex systems.
- Stewards, facilitators, and organizers working with communities.
- Researchers in HCI, civic tech, and AI alignment.

**Core sections (sketch)**

1. **Why interaction languages matter**
   - Without shared languages, complex systems are:
     - only steerable by insiders and technical elites,
     - opaque or manipulative for everyone else.
   - Interaction languages as:
     - “ways of talking to civilization,”
     - not just UI labels.

2. **Requirements for steward-facing languages**
   - Properties we need:
     - low jargon, high respect,
     - legible connection to guarantees and levers,
     - resilience against dark patterns and nudging.

3. **CoGBx: a concrete attempt**
   - Overview from CoGBx_Charter_v0.md.
   - Key design choices:
     - use of metaphors like City / Studio / Garden,
     - intent cards for displaced workers and local organizers,
     - separation between human-facing language and AI/internal schemas.

4. **GroupBuild as first field lab**
   - How CoGBx appears in GroupBuild:
     - paths (City, Studio, Garden),
     - CoGBx intent cards:
       - displaced worker,
       - local organizer.
   - Early patterns:
     - what kinds of prompts and questions people actually use,
     - how guarantees are reflected back.

5. **From local languages to a CoTheoryCiv layer**
   - How interaction languages sit on top of:
     - ensured layers (A2),
     - attractor understanding (A1).
   - How multiple field labs and cultures might:
     - share some backbone concepts,
     - keep their own metaphors and stories.

6. **Open questions and next moves**
   - Research/implementation agenda:
     - metrics for “respectful and effective” interaction languages,
     - how to prevent co-option by cores,
     - how to keep these languages evolving at the edge.

**Connections**

- Builds on:
  - CoGBx_Charter_v0.md,
  - GroupBuild CoPortal and intent cards,
  - GroupBuild site copy (GB_Home_v1, GB_Paths_CityStudioGarden_v1).
- Bridges back to:
  - A1 (why futures and attractors matter),
  - A2 (how guarantees are ensured),
  - CoTheoryCiv megascroll segments.

## Notes for future versions

Later versions of this outline file should:

- mark which sections have been fleshed out into full drafts,
- note co-authors and field labs contributing examples,
- record which preprint / publication venues are being targeted,
- track where media-friendly and children-of-the-new-world excerpts live.
