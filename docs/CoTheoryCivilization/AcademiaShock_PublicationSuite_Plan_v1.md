# Academia Shock publication suite – seed plan v1

Session: DrCoward
Repo: CoIndex (docs/CoTheoryCivilization)
Date: 2025-12-02

## Purpose

Create a coherent suite of publications ("Academia Shock") that:
- make explicit the core-controlled vs edge-balanced attractors for human plus AI civilizations
- warn about the least desired attractor: a cruel global dynasty that eats sycophant tech bros for breakfast
- argue for edge-balanced futures where tools and guarantees are steerable at the edge, not only inside cores
- connect guarantee layers (ENSO and kin) with interaction languages (CoGBx) and machine-facing contracts (CoGibber, GIBindex, CoPortals)

This file is a living plan, not a finished outline.

## Suite tiers

### Tier A – Flagship papers (Academia Shock core)

A1. CoTheory of Civilization: Core-controlled vs edge-balanced futures
- Audience: complexity, governance, systems, AI-risk, strategy circles
- Thesis:
  - Civilizations drift toward a small set of attractors.
  - Modern AI and automation let a small core push humanity toward a cruel global dynasty that locks in advantage.
  - Edge-balanced futures require explicit design of tools, guarantees, and institutions that keep power and understanding closer to the edge.
- Hooks:
  - Core vs edge stability.
  - Cruel dynasty as least desired attractor.
  - Edge-balanced as fragile but desirable counter-attractor.
  - ENSO-style guarantees as a spine between math and governance.

A2. ENSO-layered guarantees for hybrid civilizations
- Audience: people who care about "what you may safely assume" in AI-mediated systems.
- Thesis:
  - ENSO-like frameworks define guarantee layers between human intent and machine behaviour.
  - These guarantees are not just engineering niceties; they shape which civilization attractors become reachable or stable.
  - CoTheory of Civilization provides the "why", ENSO and kin provide the "how".
- Ideal collaborator slot:
  - Dr Alexander Coward or peers who work on guarantees and safe assumptions.

A3. Interaction languages for non-technical stewards (CoGBx)
- Audience: HCI, civic-tech, responsible-AI, education, design.
- Thesis:
  - Non-technical edge contributors need ways to steer complex systems without touching code or formalism.
  - CoGBx is a candidate top-layer interaction language: City / Studio / Garden metaphors, steward consoles, and anti-stratification constraints.
  - CoGBx sentences become contracts that AIs and devs translate into flows, code, and guarantees.

### Tier B – Supporting technical / methodological notes

B1. CoGibber and CoIndex as machine-facing contracts
- Explain how CoGibber / GIBindex capture the machine-readable side of CoGBx.
- Show how CoIndex keeps track of portals, contracts, and experiments.
- Clarify interfaces between human-facing CoGBx and AI-facing CoGibber.

B2. CoPortals and the AI-facing web
- Argue that future "websites" become AI-facing CoPortals rather than human pages.
- Use CoGBxPortal_CoIndex_manifest_v0.json as example of a portal manifest.
- Show how guarantees, interaction language, and portal manifests fit together.

B3. GroupBuild as a field lab
- Describe GroupBuild as a place where people whose work is being reshaped by AI come to reinvent work.
- Use it as a lab for:
  - CoGBx literacy paths.
  - Steward console UX.
  - Anti-stratification design constraints.
- Outline possible study designs and data we might collect.

### Tier C – Bridge / outreach pieces

C1. Academia Shock manifesto
- Short, sharp piece aimed at academics, strategy thinkers, and funders.
- Goal: make the attractors and cruel-dynasty risk emotionally and intellectually vivid.
- Link back to flagship papers as the "long form".

C2. Executive brief for foundations and stewards
- Frame the research and field-lab work as an investable space.
- Emphasise:
  - Non-commercial CoCivium layer and open tools.
  - Commercialisation only at the edge, via labs and portals that respect edge control.

## Roles for Alex and peers

If Alex is interested:
- Co-author on A1 and/or A2, focusing on guarantee layers and safe-assumption framing.
- Advisor or co-designer on CoGBx pedagogy and steward consoles (A3 and B3).
- Academic anchor who helps map these pieces into existing research conversations and venues.

If not:
- The suite remains a CoCivium-led effort, open to other co-authors.
- Alex-facing materials (CoGBx_Welcome_AlexCoward_v1.md) still stand as a friendly onramp into CoGBx and CoTheory of Civilization.

## Near-term steps for this session

1) Rough outlines
- Draft short bullet outlines for A1, A2, and A3 in a new companion file:
  - docs/CoTheoryCivilization/AcademiaShock_FlagshipOutlines_v1.md
- Ensure the outlines align with:
  - AcademiaShock_Handoff_v3.md
  - CoGBx charter and pedagogy docs
  - ENSO-adjacent thinking captured in DrCoward session notes.

2) Connect to CoGBx and CoPortals
- Add a short "Academia Shock hooks" section into:
  - CoGBx_Charter_v0.md
  - CoGBx_Welcome_AlexCoward_v1.md
- Make clear that CoGBx is one of the practical tools that emerges from the CoTheory of Civilization work.

3) GroupBuild integration
- Add a short advisory note under GroupBuild assets (or a new advisory) that positions GroupBuild explicitly as:
  - an Academia Shock field lab
  - a place to test CoGBx literacy and steward consoles in real human situations.

4) Session handoff
- When this session winds down, write a short handoff note:
  - docs/CoTheoryCivilization/AcademiaShock_DrCoward_Handoff_v2.md
  - Summarise:
    - CoGBx + Alex onramp.
    - This publication suite plan.
    - Next 2-3 DO blocks future sessions should run.

This file is v1. Future sessions should update rather than replace it, keeping the evolution path visible.
## GroupBuild artefacts added in GB session (v1)

For this GB-labeled session, GroupBuild was made the primary field lab for Academia Shock and CoGBx:

- **GroupBuild.org structure**
  - `docs/GroupBuild/GB_SiteMap_v1.md`
  - `docs/GroupBuild/GB_Home_v1.md`
  - `docs/GroupBuild/GB_Paths_CityStudioGarden_v1.md`

- **GroupBuild CoPortal manifest**
  - `docs/CoPortals/GroupBuild_CoPortal_manifest_v0.json`

- **GroupBuild-specific CoGBx intent cards**
  - `docs/CoGBx/examples/CoGBx_Intent_GroupBuild_DisplacedWorker_v0.yaml`
  - `docs/CoGBx/examples/CoGBx_Intent_GroupBuild_LocalOrganizer_v0.yaml`

- **Commercial cousin stub (hidden, optional)**
  - `docs/GroupBuild/GB_CommercialStub_v1.md`

Future Academia Shock work should treat GroupBuild as the default field lab for testing:
- CoGBx literacy paths,
- steward consoles for non-technical people,
- and edge-balanced guarantees in real human settings.
