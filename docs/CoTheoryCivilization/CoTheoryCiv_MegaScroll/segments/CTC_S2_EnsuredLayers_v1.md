# CTC S2 Ensured layers – what you may safely assume (v1 stub)

This segment focuses on "ensured layers" in a hybrid civilization.

The core idea:

- Between human intent and machine behaviour there must be layers of guarantees.
- These layers say, in effect, "what you may safely assume" about how systems
  will behave when you act in good faith.

In this framing:

- ENSO like work and related guarantee frameworks become the spine between:
  - abstract theory about attractors and futures,
  - concrete engineering decisions about protocols, platforms, and portals,
  - institutional designs about who can change which guarantees.

This stub will ultimately:

- connect CoTheoryCiv to ENSO layered guarantees and similar efforts,
- spell out example guarantee stacks (from civic services to AI interfaces),
- show how weak guarantees make cruel dynasties easier to lock in,
- show how strong, edge respecting guarantees make edge balanced futures
  slightly less fragile.

Later versions should:

- define a small vocabulary for guarantee layers,
- show how those layers appear inside CoPortals and interaction languages,
- outline research questions for Academia Shock A2 and the technical notes.
