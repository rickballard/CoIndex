# CTC S1 Attractors – core controlled vs edge balanced futures (v1 stub)

This segment introduces the idea that human plus AI civilizations drift toward
a small set of attractors.

It sets up a contrast between:

- core controlled futures
  - where a small number of cores (institutions, platforms, regimes, stacked
    infrastructures) can lock in advantage,
  - and where AI plus automation makes it cheap to surveil, steer, and
    punish at global scale.

- edge balanced futures
  - where tools and guarantees keep understanding and steering power closer to
    the edge,
  - where many small groups can still invent, veto, and re-route.

It also names the least desired attractor:

- the cruel dynasty
  - a long lived pattern where a global core treats humans as resources to be
    managed,
  - and where even the sycophants who helped build that core are eventually
    eaten by it.

This stub is a placeholder:

- It signals that attractors will be treated rigorously (not just as metaphors).
- It will eventually hold definitions, diagrams, and references tied into the
  Academia Shock flagship work (especially A1).

Later versions should:

- write down a clear taxonomy of attractors and counter attractors,
- connect to existing complexity and governance literature,
- and show how AI makes certain attractors far easier to reach than before.
