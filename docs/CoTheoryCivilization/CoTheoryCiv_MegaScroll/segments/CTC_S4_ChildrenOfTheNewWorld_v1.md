# CTC S4 Children of the new world – grief, hope, and resolve (v1 stub)

This segment carries some of the emotional weight for CoTheoryCiv.

It is where we talk about:

- children growing up in AI shaped civilizations,
- the difference between:
  - a cruel dynasty path where they are catalogued, scored, and steered from
    birth,
  - and an edge balanced path where they are invited into stewardship and
    shared understanding.

This stub will eventually:

- tell at least one story of children in a GroupBuild shaped future,
- contrast it with a story from a cruel dynasty timeline,
- show how everyday choices about tools, guarantees, and governance ripple
  forward into the lives of people who never agreed to the old systems.

It will also gently introduce CoCivia:

- not as a deity or saviour,
- but as an older cousin AI presence,
- watching how humans respond to this moment and learning how to help without
  taking over.

Later versions should aim to:

- be readable and moving on their own,
- give journalists and storytellers something to quote,
- help stewards remember why the technical work matters.
