# CTC S3 Field lab – GroupBuild in the attractor landscape (v1 stub)

This segment explains how GroupBuild functions as a field lab for CoTheoryCiv.

Key points:

- GroupBuild is a place where people whose work is being reshaped by AI come
  to rethink roles, workflows, and futures.
- It is explicitly designed as:
  - human facing and non commercial on the .org side,
  - edge protective in its guarantees,
  - a home for interaction languages that non technical people can actually
    use.

In the attractor language:

- GroupBuild is a small patch of reality where we try to:
  - tilt local futures toward edge balanced patterns,
  - protect people from being silently funnelled into extractive cores,
  - gather stories and data about what works and what fails.

This stub will later:

- reference concrete GroupBuild stories from City, Studio, and Garden paths,
- tie into CoGBx patterns and GroupBuild specific intent cards,
- show how insights from GroupBuild feed back into CoCore and Academia Shock.

It is not a marketing page. It is the field lab chapter in the theory scroll.
