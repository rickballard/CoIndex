# CoTheoryCiv megascroll notes v1

This file is for editors and stewards, not for public readers.

It can record:

- decisions about ordering and inclusion of segments,
- notes on tone and accessibility for different audiences,
- reminders about which stories or diagrams still need to be written.

For now it simply marks that the megascroll basket exists and that helpers like
Co1 are expected to use the manifest rather than hard coding segment order.
