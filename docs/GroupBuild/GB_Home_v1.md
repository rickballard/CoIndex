# GroupBuild – a place to rethink work in a hybrid world

## A calm starting point

Many of us are watching AI move into our jobs, our feeds, and our institutions faster than we can keep up.

GroupBuild is a place for people in that position to pause, talk things through, and redesign work and roles *with* AI instead of being quietly pushed aside by it.

We care most about people at the edge of organizations and communities – the people who feel the impact first but rarely get to design the systems.

## What you can do here

On GroupBuild.org you can:

- **Tell a simple story about where you are now**  
  In language like *city*, *studio*, and *garden*, rather than in technical jargon.

- **Name what you want to change or protect**  
  For example:
  - “I don’t want my job to become pure surveillance.”
  - “I want AI to help, but not to erase the human parts I care about.”

- **Get structured help from humans and AIs together**  
  Stewards and AI helpers work from your description to suggest:
  - safer workflows;
  - experiments you could try;
  - questions to bring back to your team or community.

Under the surface, we use a small interaction language (CoGBx) so that:
- you can stay in plain language, and  
- AIs and developers can still see and honour clear guardrails.

## Who this is for (v1)

GroupBuild is especially for people who:

- feel they are being “optimized” by AI systems they did not design;
- want to keep their dignity, agency, and craft in the middle of change;
- are willing to experiment, but do not want to be talked down to or buried in buzzwords.

You do not need to know how AI works.  
You just need to know what kind of place you want to live and work in.

## Where to go next

From here, most visitors will:

1. Visit **Paths** to see the City / Studio / Garden frames.
2. Read a couple of **Stories from the edge**.
3. Decide whether they want to:
   - join a conversation,
   - try a small experiment,
   - or simply borrow language for their own discussions.

As GroupBuild matures, this page will link into specific cohorts, labs, and steward consoles. For now, it is a clear, simple doorway into a broader edge-balanced project.
