# GroupBuild commercial cousin – stub v1

Session: GB
Repo: CoIndex (docs/GroupBuild)
Date: 2025-12-02

This file is a placeholder for a future, explicitly commercial cousin of GroupBuild.org.

## Purpose

- Offer steward consoles, pattern libraries, and facilitated labs to organizations.
- Turn lessons from GroupBuild.org and Academia Shock into services that can fund more open work.
- Keep the non-commercial CoCivium and GroupBuild.org layers clearly separated.

## Who this cousin would serve

- Organizations whose workers and communities are already in GroupBuild-like situations:
  - unions, professional associations, and guilds;
  - public-sector agencies facing rapid AI-driven change;
  - mid-size companies that want to move toward edge-balanced practices.

## What it might offer (candidate list)

- **Steward console deployments**
  - Hosted or on-prem versions of steward consoles using CoGBx as the interaction language.
  - Training and support for internal stewards.

- **Pattern libraries and playbooks**
  - Curated CoGBx patterns for:
    - displaced-worker transitions;
    - AI-augmented team workflows;
    - community-facing communication and consent.

- **Cohorts and labs**
  - Time-bounded GroupBuild-style cohorts for:
    - teams reconceiving their work with AI;
    - leaders exploring edge-balanced governance structures;
    - educators and facilitators.

## Guardrails for commercialization

- CoCivium core remains non-commercial and open where possible.
- GroupBuild.org remains community-first and does not become a funnel.
- Any commercial offering:
  - is clearly separate (brand and domain);
  - respects edge control and avoids dark patterns;
  - publishes at least some of its learning back into the non-commercial layer.

## Open questions

- Where should this cousin live?
  - Separate repo and domain?
  - Subdomain aligned with GroupBuild branding?
- How do we prevent commercial incentives from pulling us back toward core-controlled futures?
- Which offerings are most likely to support stewards and edge contributors, not just executives?

This stub is not a commitment. It is a sketch for future sessions to refine or discard.
