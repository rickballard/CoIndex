# GroupBuild.org – sitemap v1

Session: GB  
Repo: CoIndex (docs/GroupBuild)  
Date: 2025-12-02

GroupBuild.org is a human-facing, non-commercial site for people whose lives and work are being reshaped by AI.

Tone:
- Calm, practical, non-technical.
- Emphasis on re-cover, refocus, and co-evolve – not on hype.
- Light hints of CoTheory of Civilization and edge-balanced futures, without jargon.

## Top-level navigation (v1)

1. **Home**
   - Tagline and 2–3 sentence summary.
   - Clear “What is GroupBuild?” box.
   - Primary actions:
     - “I want to reorient my work”
     - “I want to support others”

2. **Why GroupBuild**
   - Short story about hybrid society:
     - Tools are getting stronger.
     - Many people feel left behind or exposed.
     - We want those people at the *edge* to have language, tools, and allies.
   - Simple sketch of “core-controlled vs edge-balanced” futures in plain language.

3. **Paths**
   - Explainer for the three core metaphors:
     - **City** – public spaces, shared norms, common infrastructure.
     - **Studio** – focused work, small teams, experiments.
     - **Garden** – slower growth, care, and long-term stewardship.
   - Each path answers:
     - “What does this feel like?”
     - “What kinds of changes belong here?”
     - “How might AI help, without taking over?”

4. **How it works**
   - 3-step overview, in human language:
     1. Describe where you are (City / Studio / Garden).
     2. Describe what you want to change or protect.
     3. Let AI helpers and human stewards suggest safe next steps.
   - Gentle mention that under the surface we use languages like CoGBx to keep AIs aligned with human intent.

5. **Stories from the edge**
   - Short anonymised vignettes:
     - Displaced worker redesigning their role with AI.
     - Local organizer using AI to support a community.
     - Small team prototyping a safer workflow with AI.
   - Each story links back to a Path and to “How it works”.

6. **Resources**
   - Simple reading list:
     - “Feeling overwhelmed by AI?” style pieces.
     - Links to plain-language explainers for:
       - GroupBuild
       - CoGBx (described as “the language we use with AIs”)
       - CoCivium (described as “the open, non-commercial layer behind the scenes”).

7. **About the stewards**
   - Introduce GroupBuild as part of a wider steward-led effort.
   - Emphasise:
     - No single hero or owner.
     - Preference for edge-balanced futures.
     - Commitment to transparency and open tools where possible.

8. **FAQ**
   - “Is this therapy?” (No, it’s about redesigning work and roles.)
   - “Do I have to understand AI?” (No, we focus on the parts you can steer.)
   - “Is this trying to sell me something?” (The .org is non-commercial; any commercial offerings are separate and opt-in.)

## Internal notes for CoSuite / CoIndex

- This sitemap is a narrative scaffold, not a formal spec.
- As GroupBuild assets move into a dedicated repo, this file should be mirrored or referenced from there.
- Future versions (v2, v3, …) should:
  - Add concrete links into specific GroupBuild pages.
  - Reflect any CoGBx or CoPortal manifests that point into GroupBuild.
### Notes – CoPortals and Academia Shock (v1)

- GroupBuild.org has a CoPortal manifest so AI systems can treat it as a
  clearly-scoped place with edge-protective guarantees:
  - `docs/CoPortals/GroupBuild_CoPortal_manifest_v0.json`

- CoGBx intent cards capturing common GroupBuild situations live under:
  - `docs/CoGBx/examples/CoGBx_Intent_GroupBuild_DisplacedWorker_v0.yaml`
  - `docs/CoGBx/examples/CoGBx_Intent_GroupBuild_LocalOrganizer_v0.yaml`

- In the Academia Shock publication suite, GroupBuild is the primary field lab
  where we test whether interaction languages and steward consoles actually
  help non-technical people steer complex AI-heavy systems.
