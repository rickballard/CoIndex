# Paths – City, Studio, and Garden

When people first arrive at GroupBuild, we do not ask them to learn new jargon or fill out technical forms.

Instead, we invite them to see their situation through three simple lenses:

- **City**
- **Studio**
- **Garden**

Each path is a way of talking about *where* you are and *what* you are trying to change, in everyday language.

## City – shared spaces and public rules

Choose **City** when you are thinking about:

- public-facing websites, services, or institutions;
- shared norms and policies;
- how lots of people move through the same “streets” and “squares”.

Questions that belong in the City path:

- “What should people be able to rely on when they first arrive?”
- “What do we want to make easier, and what do we want to make harder?”
- “Where can AI help people find their way, without quietly steering them somewhere they did not choose?”

City work tends to involve:
- signage and explanations,
- default settings,
- cross-cutting rules that apply to many people.

## Studio – focused work and experiments

Choose **Studio** when you are thinking about:

- a team,
- a project,
- or a personal practice where you actually do the work.

Questions that belong in the Studio path:

- “What does a good day’s work look like for us?”
- “Where would we welcome automation, and where would that feel like a loss?”
- “What experiments could we run this month without risking too much?”

Studio work tends to involve:
- daily or weekly rhythms,
- small adjustments to tools and workflows,
- experiments that we can evaluate honestly.

## Garden – care, growth, and the long term

Choose **Garden** when you are thinking about:

- people’s growth over time,
- cultures and relationships,
- things that cannot be rushed without damage.

Questions that belong in the Garden path:

- “Who is being quietly exhausted or excluded by the way things work now?”
- “What do we want to still be true about this place in ten years?”
- “Where might AI help us notice harm earlier, or support people more gently?”

Garden work tends to involve:
- invitations and boundaries,
- mentorship and learning paths,
- watching for slow, hard-to-see changes.

## How AIs fit in (without taking over)

Behind these three paths, we use an interaction language called **CoGBx** to talk to AI systems in a structured way.

Roughly:

- You describe your situation in City / Studio / Garden terms.
- Stewards and AIs turn that into more precise “promises and guardrails” for the systems involved.
- You stay in human language; the machinery stays behind the scenes.

You never have to say “CoGBx” out loud.  
You just have to be honest about where you are, what you care about, and what you are willing to try.
