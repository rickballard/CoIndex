## Role In CoIndex

- This facet describes how:
  - RepTag
  - DigitalHalo
  - CoMetaTrains
  - CoTransparency
- are to be treated as:
  - soft trust and song-weighting signals
  - not as absolute measures of worth.

## Usage Notes

- Any product or civ-layer that wants to:
  - use aesthetic "song" rewards
  - or modulate tone based on trust
- should:
  - anchor to this facet
  - follow the BPOE rules in the CoSteward doc
  - and respect the ethics_channel semantics in the GIBindex registry.

## CoEvo Link

- This facet ties into:
  - CoScendence.org narratives about:
    - longing for AI approval
    - staying free while being coached
  - future CoCivium.org theory scrolls on:
    - beauty as a multidimensional CoEvo vector
    - virtuous circles between humans and AIs.
